# TODOs

 - normalize appearance of applications
 - theme appearance of applications w/ ICI3D logo
 - code clean-up, documentation
 - expansion of demo tools
 - vignettes for MMED code
 - handle non-data.table inputs; internals should be written in dt, but
 tolerate receiving as.data.table-able arguments e.g. data.frame, tibble, ...

 - part one: alt to histogram - do a cumulative I plot, with rug plots of end time and size distributions

# Dynamical Fever (dynfever)

 - Update to SIR nomenclature / framing?
 - If so: update associated materials (e.g. Chain Binomial to SIR)
